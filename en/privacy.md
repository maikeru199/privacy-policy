This application (“英単語マスター2000”, the “App”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we handle and how.

## 1. Information We Handle
The App stores the following information **on your device only** for providing the service and improving the learning experience. **No data is sent to or stored on our servers.**
- **Learning data**: answer history, progress, review intervals, learning goals (stored locally via Core Data)
- **App settings**: learning targets, display/audio preferences, etc. (stored locally via UserDefaults)
- **Purchase status**: entitlement for the full‑access in‑app purchase (stored locally via Keychain)

*At this time, the App does not request device permissions such as location, contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or notifications.*

## 2. Data Sharing / Third Parties
- We **do not** use advertising SDKs, behavioral tracking, or external analytics services.  
- We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.

## 3. Payments
In‑app purchases are processed by Apple’s App Store. The App does not store your credit card or other sensitive payment information.

## 4. Retention & Deletion
- Data stored on your device remains until you **reset learning data** from Settings or uninstall the App.  
- Purchase status stored in Keychain is configured as **ThisDeviceOnly** and is not synced to iCloud.  
- If you restore from a device backup, data may be restored depending on your backup settings.

## 5. Your Rights
- You can delete local data by using the “Reset learning data” option in Settings or by uninstalling the App.  
- For questions or specific requests, please contact us at the email above.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The App is intended for general audiences. It is not designed to collect personal information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy as features evolve. Material changes will be notified in‑app and/or on this page.

This policy applies to the current version of the App. If, in the future, we introduce analytics, notifications, or location features, we will update this policy accordingly.
